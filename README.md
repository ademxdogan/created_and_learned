Hello, I am Adem DOÄžAN. I have been working as SysAdmin, Cloud Admin at TUBITAK ULAKBIM (The Turkish Academic Network and Information Centre) since December 15, 2022.

I use Openstack, KVM, Nagios (with nrpe), Prometheus, Grafana, Pf, Bind and dozens of other software that I can't think of while working here. 

I keep the scripts I produce for some needs in this repo and update them as they accumulate.
