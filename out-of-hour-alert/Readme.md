A mechanism designed to generate an alarm when logged in outside working hours via OpenVPN and SSH. It is written for a FreeBSD server and its alarm is generated by the nagios nrpe plugin.

auth_checker.py; When the script runs, it checks whether anyone has logged in in the last 5 minutes. If anyone is logged in, it writes its information to a directory. With cronjob, it should be run every 5 minutes during working hours.

file_checker.sh; Script triggered by nrpe. When it is run, it detects whether the file produced by auth_checker.py exists or not, deletes the file and returns to nagios as an alarm. Make sure that this script checks the file path written by auth_checker.py.
